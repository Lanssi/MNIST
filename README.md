# My MNIST Project

This is my first step to Deep Learning  
The goal is re-implementing the MNIST project with 2 types of Network, which respectively are:  
Fully connected Nueral Network(or FC), and  
Convolutional Nueral Netowrk(or CNN)

# File Structure:
`data`: where the MNIST data is stored, including training set samples and labels, test set samples and labels  
`__main__.py`: The main file, containing operations of loading datasets, training and testing the model  
`FC.py`: definition of FC Network  
`CNN.py`: definition the code of CNN Network
