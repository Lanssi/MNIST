#My MNIST Project

##This is my first step to Deep Learning
##I want to re-implement the MNIST with 2 types of Network, which respectively are:
##Fully connected Nueral Network(or FC), and
##Convolutional Nueral Netowrk(or CNN)

##File Structure:
###data: store the MNIST data, including training set samples and labels, test set samples and labels
###FC: Include the code of FC Network
###CNN: Include the code of CNN Network
